## Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

-----------------------------------------------------------

This project required us to read the data gathered by the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" and create a final tidy data that encapsulates all the information.

Following steps were performed before starting the analysis to create a tidy dataset
1. Download the zip folder provided in the URL on the course
2. Extract the following files into the working directory of R
    * features.txt
    * activity_labels.txt
    * subject_train.txt
    * subject_test.txt
    * X_train.txt
    * X_test.txt
    * y_train.txt
    * y_test.txt

Once the above steps are completed, run the script run_analysis.R. The output of the script saves the tidy data tidyData.txt back in your working directory.
